# Chat

An advanced toolkit for prompt engineering and code interaction with large language models.

## Core Philosophy

This application is designed to be a universal client for interacting with various AI providers. It will feature a pluggable API module that allows you to connect to any language model provider (such as Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic, and more) through a single, unified interface.

## Features

*   **Interactive Chat:** A powerful and fast interface for conversing with language models.
*   **Advanced Prompt Engineering:** A dedicated environment for crafting, testing, and refining prompts.
*   **Few-Shot Learning:** Easily provide examples to the model to improve response accuracy and relevance.
*   **Context Management:** Fine-grained control over the conversation history sent to the model.
*   **Response Streaming:** Get real-time output from the language model as it's being generated.
*   **Usage Tracking:** Monitor token usage to keep track of costs and performance.
*   **Multi-Provider Model Selection:** Seamlessly switch between different language models from various providers.
*   **Project Management:** Save and load conversations, prompts, and project configurations.
*   **Secure API Key Storage:** Keep your API keys safe and secure.
*   **Flexible Configuration:** Adjust neural network settings at each step of the dialogue.
*   **Configuration History:** Save and access previous configuration settings.
*   **Context Enrichment:** Simple and clear methods for enriching and managing context.
*   **Editable Prompts:** Edit user prompts at any stage and regenerate responses.
*   **Dialogue Visualization:** Visualize the conversation as a message tree for better prompt management.

## Installation

## Usage

```bash
# Usage examples will be added here.
```

## Configuration

To get started, you will need an API key from your chosen AI provider. The application can be configured to use one or more keys.

Set the appropriate environment variables for the providers you wish to use:

```bash
# Example for a generic provider
export PROVIDER_API_KEY='your_api_key'
```

## Future Development

*   A graphical user interface (GUI) for an even more intuitive user experience.
*   Expanded support for a wider range of AI providers and models.
